# AdventureworksDB2005
The Adventureworks Database for SQL 2005
I recently took a Web Based Training (WBT) course that required the Microsoft Adventureworks DB 2005 that the instructor used, but did not provide with the WBT course.

Microsoft has taken down the links/redirects and is almost impossible to find this file. The following links are dead:

This link:

provides a PDF as a download, that states the following:
SQL Server Samples Have Moved
SQL Server code samples and sample databases are now hosted on CodePlex. Codeplex is the project hosting site for Microsoft SQL Server Samples and Community Projects. The portal page for SQL Server on Codeplex catalogs samples included with Product Releases, samples from the community, and independent SQL Server Community projects. Visit the SQL Server Samples and Community Projects page on CodePlex at:
https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=SqlServerSamples (DEAD LINK)

At the time of this writing: https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples, but that too left me puzzled.

After a very long search, I was able to download the files, but now are no longer available. I have made them available for download. To avoid overage of my bandwidth, <strike>please request for a password (comment below), if you have not been provided one. If you see a message that the download has exceeded the limit, the limit will be reset once the password has been reset.</strike> I have opened a repository on GitHub.
